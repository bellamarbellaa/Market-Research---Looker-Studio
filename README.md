# Market-Research---Looker-Studio
This repository contains a Looker dashboard, presentation deck, and survey form developed as part of Market Research for an offline networking event for alumni and members of StudentxCEO Jakarta. I integrated quantitative and qualitative data from primary source (Google Form branching survey) and secondary sources (benchmark &amp; brainstorming).
