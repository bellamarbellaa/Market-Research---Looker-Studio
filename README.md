This repository contains a Looker dashboard, presentation deck, and survey form developed as part of Market Research for an offline networking event for alumni and members of StudentxCEO Jakarta. I integrated quantitative and qualitative data from primary source (Google Form branching survey) and secondary sources (benchmark &amp; brainstorming). 

What I worked on for this project:
 1. Designed a branching survey form tailored to alumni and membersâ€™ preferences and availability. This involves brainstorming and benchmark research to including time windows & area accessibility, event session priorities, types of preferred networking, and post-event engagement choices.
 2. Coordinated with the Operations Division for schedule alignment and expectation setting.
 3. Identified and broke down key event planning questions for analysis.
 4. Answered critical planning questions based on insights, grouped into logistics, event concept, networking, and post-event engagement
 5. Analyzed data using Microsoft Excel, involving filtering, sorting, and summarizing information based on research questions
 6. Curated a list of recommended alumni speakers based on availability and experience
 7. Developed an interactive and insight-rich multi-page dashboard using Google Looker Studio, exploring features like filter control, calculated fields, custom bar and pie charts, segmented analysis using tables, and geo-mapping
 8. Built a comprehensive slide deck that includes key visuals for every insight and additional recommendations on general atmosphere, venue, dress code, and merchandise for the event
